# ZVBI library interface module

This repository contains the sources of the Perl "Video-ZVBI" module, which has its
official home at [https://metacpan.org/pod/Video::ZVBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Video::ZVBI).
Please use the ticket interfaces at CPAN for reporting issues.

This Perl extension module provides an object-oriented interface to the
[ZVBI library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html).
The ZVBI library allows to access broadcast data services such as
teletext or closed captions via analog or DVB video capture devices.

Official ZVBI library description:

> The ZVBI library provides routines to access raw VBI sampling devices
> (currently the Linux V4L and and V4L2 API and the FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
> NetBSD and BSDi bktr driver API are supported), a versatile raw VBI
> bit slicer, decoders for various data services and basic search, render
> and export functions for text pages. The library was written for the
> Zapping TV viewer and Zapzilla Teletext browser.

The ZVBI Perl module covers all exported libzvbi functions.

The Perl interface is largely based on blessed references to binary
pointers. Internally the module uses the native C structures of libzvbi
as far as possible.  Only in the last step, when a Perl script wants
to manipulate captured data directly (i.e. not via library functions),
the structures' data is copied into Perl data types.  This approach
allows for a pretty snappy performance.

Best starting point to get familiar with the module is to have a look
at the ZVBI library documentation (generated by doxygen when building ZVBI)
and the examples scripts provided in the <A HREF="Video-ZVBI/examples/">examples/</A>
subdirectory: these are more or less direct C to Perl ports of the respective programs
in the `test/` subdirectory of the libzvbi source tree, plus a few additions,
such as a teletext level 2.5 browser implemented in apx. 300 lines of
[Perl::Tk](https://metacpan.org/pod/Tcl::Tk).

## Comparison with the Video-Capture-VBI module

You may have noticed that there already is a Perl VBI module which
provides very similar functionality.  The approach is completely
different though: The older VBI module contains an actual implementation
of a teletext and VPS slicers and databases, while ZVBI is an interface
layer to an external C library.

Besides that, the reason for not just contributing code to the
existing module was that libzvbi alone can almost entirely replace
the older VBI module (i.e. it covers the same functionality, except
currently for the high-level "nexTView" EPG decoding.)  So there would
not much to be gained by merging the code. On the other hand, libzvbi
supports much more platforms, drivers (e.g. V4L2, DVB, BSD) and services,
so that it seems warranted to make that available to the Perl universe.

Other benefits are that libzvbi has extensive documentation and is
optimized for performance (i.e. the ZVBI Perl module is several times
times faster when capturing teletext packets into a file compared
to the VBI module.)  The only downside is EPG decoding (ETS 300 707),
which is supported by the VBI module, but not by libzvbi.

## BETA WARNING

This module is still a beta release. Hence interfaces may change in
in incompatible ways or even interfaces may be renamed. If you plan
to use this module in a large project please let me know. Once the
module has been validated in a larger project the beta status may
be terminated.

## Installation

Pre-requisite to the installation is a C compiler and the
[libzvbi library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html)
(oldest supported version is 0.2.16, or 0.2.4 when disabling
`USE_DL_SYM` in <A HREF="Video-ZVBI/Makefile.PL">Makefile.PL</A>)
which in turn requires the pthreads and
PNG libraries. Once you have these, installation is done in the
usual steps:

```console
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
```

Note there are no dependencies on other Perl modules by the module itself.
Some of provided example scripts however depend on
[Perl::Tk](https://metacpan.org/pod/Tcl::Tk)

Trouble-shooting note: By default the module compiles against an
internal copy of libzvbi.h and loads symbols added in recent library
versions during module start from the shared library. If your compiled
module doesn't load, try disabling the respective compile switches
in Makefile.PL

## Bug reports

Please submit bug reports relating to the interface module via
[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Video::ZVBI). Feel free to also mail me
about feature requests or interface improvements.

If your bug report or request relates to libzvbi rather than the
interface module, please contact the libzvbi authors, preferrably
via the [Zapping](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/) mailing list.
In case of capture problems, please make sure to specify which
operating system and hardware you are using, and of course which
version of libzvbi and which version of Perl and the ZVBI module
respectively.
